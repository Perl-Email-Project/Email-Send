  - SMTP was broken. I made a horrible mistake with my use of eval.

    diagnostics.

  - Make Email::Send::SMTP use Return::Value for its returns. These
    are compatible with previous behavior, but offer more detail on
    just what went wrong.
  - Require Return::Value as a dependency. Other mailers may begin
    using it for returns in the future.

1.43   2004-08-07

  - Make Email::Send::SMTP send args to Net::SMTP with host first.
    This makes older Net::SMTPs happy.

1.2    2004-06-29

  - Email::Send::SMTP now sends multiple MAIL commands for
    each address in the To and Cc headers. It does not fail
    when it encounters bad addresses, as long as at least one
    address succeeds.

  - Initial version.
