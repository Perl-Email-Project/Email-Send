          Integrated Email::Send::Test (Adam Kennedy).

          Updated Email::Send::Sendmail to provide much more detail when mail

          Updated version numbers in all packages for proper indexing.

          Changes to Makefile.PL to aid in recommended module builds.
          Alpha-release of new interface.

1.46      2005-01-08
          SMTP was broken. I made a horrible mistake with my use of eval.
          Honestly, I feel quite silly. I'm sorry.
          Added eg/send-email.pl, a program to aid in testing and debuging of
          this code.

1.45      2004-12-22
          Bug in Email::Send::SMTP in collecting addresses to send for RCPT.
          Added more error checking in Email::Send::SMTP to return proper
          diagnostics.
          Updated dependencies.

1.44      2004-12-17
          Make Email::Send::SMTP use Return::Value for its returns. These are
          compatible with previous behavior, but offer more detail on just what
          went wrong.
          Require Return::Value as a dependency. Other mailers may begin using it
          for returns in the future.

1.43      2004-08-07
          Make Email::Send::SMTP send args to Net::SMTP with host first.  This
          makes older Net::SMTPs happy.

1.42      2004-07-29
          Remove hard dependency on Email::Abstract (for IO::All).
          Declare hard dependency on Email::Simple.

          Only set defaults for $Sendmail and $Qmail in those mailers when the
          package variable is not already set (Peter Scott).
          SSL support for Email::Send::SMTP.
          Use different version scheme, I need more numbers.

1.4       2004-07-08
          Relaxed prereq on IO::All for testing.
          Included Bcc in list of addresses to MAIL TO: in Email::Send::SMTP.
          Now supports Net::SMTP's auth() (Aaron Trevena).

1.3       2004-07-05
          Doc typo in Email::Send::Sendmail (Martin 'Kingpin' Thurn).

1.2       2004-06-29
          Email::Send::SMTP now sends multiple MAIL commands for each address in
          the To and Cc headers. It does not fail when it encounters bad
          addresses, as long as at least one address succeeds.

1.1       2004-05-27
          Initial version.
